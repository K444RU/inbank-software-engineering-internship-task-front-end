This repository contains the front-end part of the Decision Engine project. The Decision Engine is designed to take in personal code, loan amount, and loan period in months, and return a decision (negative or positive) along with the approved amount.

The Decision Engine aims to determine the maximum sum that can be approved, regardless of the requested loan amount. If a suitable loan amount is not found within the selected period, the decision engine will attempt to find a new suitable period.

## Description
